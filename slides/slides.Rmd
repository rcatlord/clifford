## Fly-tipping
**28** reports of fly-tipping in Clifford ward on [fixmystreet.com](https://www.fixmystreet.com/reports/Trafford/Clifford?filter_category=Flytipping&sort=created-desc) since January 2017. The majority are reported along alleyways linking Alphonsus Street.

## Opportunities
- *Quickly clear fly-tipping:* following '[broken windows](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/03/broken-windows/304465/)' theory this helps to prevent areas from attracting further illegal waste dumping and other more serious crimes
- *Increase alleygating*: known to reduce burglary and prevent environmental anti-social behaviour such as fly-tipping and graffiti
- *Strict enforcement*: issue fixed penalty notices for [small scale fly-tipping offences](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2016/334/note/made)
- *Review waste collection services*: empty clothes recycle bins regulalry, offer a limited free bulky waste collection service
- *School engagement with police support*: discourage littering at an early stage
